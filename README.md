A [`parabar`](https://parabar.mihaiconstantin.com) is a package designed to
provide a simple interface for executing tasks in parallel, while also providing
functionality for tracking and displaying the progress of the tasks.

This package is aimed at two audiences: (1) end-users who want to execute a task
in parallel in an interactive `R` session and track the execution progress, and
(2) `R` package developers who want to use
[`parabar`](https://parabar.mihaiconstantin.com) as a solution for parallel
processing in their packages.

## Installation
We are planning to submit parabar soon to `CRAN`. In the meantime, you can
install the latest development version from GitHub using the following command:

```r
# Install the package.
remotes::install_github("mihaiconstantin/parabar")

# Load the package.
library(parabar)
```

## Usage
Below you can find a few examples of how to use
[`parabar`](https://parabar.mihaiconstantin.com) in your `R` scripts, both for
end-users, and for developers. All examples below assume that you have already
installed and loaded the package.

### Users
In general, the usage of [`parabar`](https://parabar.mihaiconstantin.com)
consists of the following steps:
1. Start a backend for parallel processing.
2. Execute a task in parallel.
3. Stop the backend.

Optionally, you can also configure the progress bar if the backend created
supports progress tracking.

#### Synchronous Backend
The simplest, and perhaps least interesting, way to use
[`parabar`](https://parabar.mihaiconstantin.com) is by requesting a synchronous
backend.

```r
# Start a synchronous backend.
backend <- start_backend(cores = 4, cluster_type = "psock", backend_type = "sync")

# Run a task in parallel.
results <- par_sapply(backend, 1:1000, function(x) {
    # Sleep a bit.
    Sys.sleep(0.01)

    # Compute and return.
    x + 1
})
```

At this point you will notice the following warning message:

```txt
Warning message:
Progress tracking not supported for backend of type 'SyncBackend'.
```

The reason for this is because progress tracking only works for asynchronous
backends. Furthermore, [`parabar`](https://parabar.mihaiconstantin.com) enables
progress tracking by default at load time. We can disable this by option to get rid
of the warning message.

```r
# Disable progress tracking.
set_option("progress_track", FALSE)
```

We can verify that the warning message is gone by running the task again,
reusing the backend we created earlier.

```r
# Run a task in parallel.
results <- par_sapply(backend, 1:1000, function(x) {
    # Sleep a bit.
    Sys.sleep(0.01)

    # Compute and return.
    x + 1
})
```

When we are done with this backend, we can stop it to free up the resources.

```r
# Stop the backend.
stop_backend(backend)
```

#### Asynchronous Backend
The more interesting way to use [`parabar`](https://parabar.mihaiconstantin.com)
is by requesting an asynchronous backend. This is the default backend type, and
highlights the strengths of the package.

First, let's ensure progress tracking is enabled (i.e., we disabled it above).

```r
# Enable progress tracking.
set_option("progress_track", TRUE)
```

Now, we can proceed with creating the backend and running the task.

```r
# Start an asynchronous backend.
backend <- start_backend(cores = 4, cluster_type = "psock", backend_type = "async")

# Run a task in parallel.
results <- par_sapply(backend, 1:1000, function(x) {
    # Sleep a bit.
    Sys.sleep(0.01)

    # Compute and return.
    x + 1
})
```

At this point, we can see that the progress bar is displayed, and that the
progress is tracked. The progress bar is updated in real-time, after each task
execution, e.g.:

```txt
 > completed 928 out of 1000 tasks [ 93%] [ 3s]
```

We can also configure the progress bar. For example, suppose we want to display
an actual progress bar.

```r
# Change the progress bar options.
configure_bar(type = "modern", format = "[:bar] :percent")

# Run a task in parallel.
results <- par_sapply(backend, 1:1000, function(x) {
    # Sleep a bit.
    Sys.sleep(0.01)

    # Compute and return.
    x + 1
})
```

The progress bar will now look like this:

```txt
[====================>-------------------------------------------------]  30%
```

By default, [`parabar`](https://parabar.mihaiconstantin.com) uses the
[`progress`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=progress) package to display the
progress bar. However, we can easily swap it with another progress bar engine.
For example, suppose we want to use the built-in
[`utils::txtProgressBar`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/txtProgressBar.html).

```r
# Change to and adjust the style of the `basic` progress bar.
configure_bar(type = "basic", style = 3)

# Run a task in parallel.
results <- par_sapply(backend, 1:1000, function(x) {
    # Sleep a bit.
    Sys.sleep(0.01)

    # Compute and return.
    x + 1
})
```

Check out `?configure_bar` for more information on the possible ways of
configuring the progress bar.

We can also disable the progress bar for asynchronous backends altogether, by
adjusting the package options.

```r
# Disable progress tracking.
set_option("progress_track", FALSE)

# Run a task in parallel.
results <- par_sapply(backend, 1:1000, function(x) {
    # Sleep a bit.
    Sys.sleep(0.01)

    # Compute and return.
    x + 1
})
```

We can stop the backend when we are done.

```r
# Stop the backend.
stop_backend(backend)
```

#### No Backend
Finally, we can also the `par_sapply` function without a backend, which will
resort to running the task sequentially by means of
[`utils::sapply`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/lapply.html).


```r
# Run the task sequentially using the `base::sapply`.
results <- par_sapply(backend = NULL, 1:300, function(x) {
    # Sleep a bit.
    Sys.sleep(0.01)

    # Compute and return.
    x + 1
})
```

### Developers
[`parabar`](https://parabar.mihaiconstantin.com) provides a reach API for
developers who want to use the package in their own projects.

From a high-level perspective, the package consists of **`backends`** and
**`contexts`** in which these backends are employed for executing tasks in
parallel.

#### Backends
A **`backend`** represents a set of operations, defined by the `Service`
interface. Backends can be synchronous (i.e., `SyncBackend`) or asynchronous
(i.e., `AsyncBackend`). The former will block the execution of the current `R`
session until the parallel task is completed, while the latter will return
immediately and the task will be executed in a background `R` session.

The `Service` interface defines the following operations:
- `start`
- `stop`
- `clear`
- `peek`
- `export`
- `evaluate`
- `sapply`
- `get_output`

Check out the documentation for `Service` for more information on each method.

#### Contexts
A **`context`** represents the specific conditions in which a backend object
operates. The default context class (i.e., `Context`) simply forwards the call
to the corresponding backend method. However, a more complex context can augment
the operation before forwarding the call to the backend. One example of a
complex context is the `ProgressDecorator` class. This class extends the regular
`Context` class and decorates the backend `sapply` operation to log the progress
after each task execution and display a progress bar.

#### Main Classes
The following are the main classes provided by `parabar`:
- `Service`: interface for backend operations
- `SyncBackend`: synchronous backend extending the abstract `Backend` class and
  implementing the `Service` interface
- `AsyncBackend`: asynchronous backend extending the abstract `Backend` class
  and implementing the `Service` interface
- `Specification`: backend specification used when starting a backend
- `BackendFactory`: factory for creating `Backend` objects
- `Context`: default context for executing backend operations without
  interference
- `ProgressDecorator`: context for decorating the `sapply` operation to track
  and display the progress
- `ContextFactory`: factory for creating `Context` objects

Additionally, [`parabar`](https://parabar.mihaiconstantin.com) also provides
several classes for creating and updating different progress bars, namely:
- `BasicBar`: a simple, but robust, bar created via
  [`utils::txtProgressBar`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/txtProgressBar.html)
  extending the `Bar` abstract class
- `ModernBar`: a modern bar created via
  [`progress::progress_bar`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=progress)
  extending the `Bar` abstract class
- `BarFactory`: factory for creating `Bar` objects

#### Examples
Below there is an example of how to use the package
[`R6`](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/r6.html) class API.

We start by creating a `Specification` object instructing the `Backend` object
how to create a cluster via the built-in function
[`parallel::makeCluster`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/parallel/html/makeCluster.html).

```r
# Create a specification object.
specification <- Specification$new()
specification$set_cores(4)
specification$set_type("psock")
```

We proceed by obtaining an asynchronous backend instance from the
`BackendFactory` and starting the backend using the `Specification` instance
above.

```r
# Create a backend factory.
backend_factory <- BackendFactory$new()

# Get an asynchronous backend instance.
backend <- backend_factory$get("async")

# Start the backend.
backend$start(specification)
```

Finally, we can run a task in parallel by calling the `sapply` method on the
`backend` instance.

```r
# Run a task in parallel.
backend$sapply(1:1000, function(x) {
    # Sleep a bit.
    Sys.sleep(0.01)

    # Compute and return.
    x + 1
})
```

At this point, the task was deployed in a background `R` session, and the caller
process is free to do other things.

Calling `backend$get_output` immediately after the `backend$sapply` call will
throw an error, indicating that the task is still running, i.e.:

```txt
Error: A task is currently running.
```

We can, however, block the caller process and wait for the task to complete
before fetching the results.

```r
results <- backend$get_output(wait = TRUE)
```

We can now introduce the `context` concept to decorate the `backend` instance
and, in this example, track the progress of the task. First, we obtain an
`Context` instance from the `ContextFactory`. Furthermore, since we are using an
asynchronous backend, we can request a context that facilitates
progress-tracking.

```r
# Create a context factory.
context_factory <- ContextFactory$new()

# Get a progress-tracking context.
context <- context_factory$get("progress")

# Register the backend with the context.
context$set_backend(backend)
```

The `Context` class (i.e., and it's subclasses) implements the `Service`
interface, which means that we can use it to execute backend operations.

Since we are using the `ProgressDecorator` context, we also need to register a
`Bar` instance with the context. First, let's obtain a `Bar` instance from the
`BarFactory`.

```r
# Create a bar factory.
bar_factory <- BarFactory$new()

# Get a `modern` bar (i.e., via `progress::progress_bar`).
bar <- bar_factory$get("modern")
```

We can now register the `bar` instance with the `context` instance.

```r
# Register the `bar` with the `context`.
context$set_bar(bar)
```

We may also configure the `bar`, or change its appearance. For instance, it may
be a good idea is to show the progress bar right away.

```r
# Configure the `bar`.
context$configure_bar(
    show_after = 0,
    format = " > completed :current out of :total tasks [:percent] [:elapsed]"
)
```

At this point, the `backend$sapply` operation is decorated with progress
tracking. Finally, we can run the task in parallel and enjoy our progress bar
using the `context` instance.

```r
# Run a task in parallel with progress tracking.
context$sapply(1:1000, function(x) {
    # Sleep a bit.
    Sys.sleep(0.01)

    # Compute and return.
    x + 1
})
```

All there is left to do is to fetch the results and stop the backend.

```r
# Get the results.
results <- context$get_output()

# Stop the backend.
context$stop()
```
