## 0.0.1
### Added
- Add `Bar` abstraction for working with progress bars in `R`. Currently, two
  types of of progress bars are supported (i.e., `BasicBar` and `ModernBar`).
  `BasicBar` uses as engine the `utils::txtProgressBar`, and `ModernBar` relies
  on the `R6` class obtained from `progress::progress_bar`. Specific concrete of
  these bar types can be requested from the `BarFactory`.
